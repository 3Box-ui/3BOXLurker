3BOXLurker is a small little RPG. It requires 1 or more players and a GM (Game Master). The characters have
two stats, ATK (Attack) and HP. ATK is randomly generated between 1 and 10 while HP is generated 
between 5 and 15.

All player's characters start in a room that is white, it has walls, a ceiling and a floor. The GM
will create a door for the characters to walk through when him/her are ready. Both the GM and the
players have to be ready. The door/warphole will appear when the GM is ready and the game starts when all
players have walked through the door/warphole.

GMs can create monsters with their own HP generated between 1 and 10. Every ATK point can be one HP
point hit from a monster. The monster has an ATK generated between 1-5 while their HP is generated in the same way as a
character but it is 5-10 instead of 5-15. When a player/monster attacks their ATK will be taken off the
enemy's HP, (HP - ATK), if (HP - ATK) is smaller than or equal to 0 then the enemy will die the next hit unless the GM
has granted a status effect or given an item that can stop the player from dying.

The GM can choose to heal or damage a player like with Poison Attacks (effects) or Healing Potions (items)
however the GM can choose to not include them.

The GM will end the game by creating the exit warphole/object and the first character to walk through will win but
if all characters are dead (they lost all their HP) then the game ends and nobody wins.
