Lurker is a small little RPG. It requires 2 or more players and a GM (Game Master). The characters have
two stats, ATK (Attack) and HP. ATK is randomly generated between 1 and 5 while HP is generated 
between 10 and 15.

All player's characters start in a room that is white, it has walls, a ceiling and a floor. The GM
will create a door for the characters to walk through when him/her are ready. Both the GM and the
players have to be ready. The door will appear when the GM is ready and the game starts when all
players have walked through the door.

GMs can create monsters with their own HP generated between 1 and 10. Every ATK point can be one HP
point hit from a monster. The monster has an ATK of 1 while their HP is generated in the same way as a
character but it is 1-10 instead of 10-15. When a player/monster attacks their ATK will be taken off the
enemy's HP, (HP - ATK), if (HP - ATK) is smaller than or equal to 0 then the enemy will die the next hit.

The GM can choose to heal or damage a player like with Poison Attacks (effects) or Healing Potions (items)
however the GM can choose to not include them.

The GM will end the game by creating the exit door and the first character to walk through will win but
if all characters are dead (they lost all their HP) then the game ends and nobody wins.
